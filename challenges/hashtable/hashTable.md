Hashtables

In Hashtable we specify an object that is used as a key, and the value we want to associate to that key. The key is then hashed, and the resulting hash code is used as the index at which the value is stored within the table


Challenge

Implement a Hashtable by Create two classes

1- Node class
2- HashTable Class

Approach & Efficiency
add function

    Space Complexity :Big O(n).
    Time complexity :Big O(n).

containes function

    Space Complexity :Big O(n).
    Time complexity :Big O(n).

get function

    Space Complexity :Big O(n).
    Time complexity :Big O(n).

hash function

    Space Complexity :Big O(n).
    Time complexity :Big O(n).
